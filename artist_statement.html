		I believe the beauty of art lies in its ability to express personal experiences in unique ways. 
		Emotions are a universal thread that connects us as people, and art serves as a bridge that deepens these connections. 
		My art is driven by feeling, which can result in passionate manifestations of personal memories. 
		Inevitably, this process makes the work both personal and universal, as exploring my own experiences gives rise to emotions that resonate on a broader, societal level. 
		My goal is for every viewer to connect with my pieces through their own perspective. 
		I want to boil down the human experience into our feelings: the joy, the sorrow, the fear — the necessary ingredients that, in my opinion, make art so powerful. <br>
As someone whose artistic methods involve touching and interacting with different textures and recycling material, digital media art seemed comparatively one-dimensional. 
I thrive on using a variety of source materials or mediums, and was unsure whether I could translate that style into the digital field, especially into coding-based art. 
In my time at SJSU, I have found that applying my art style to digital media art is not only possible, but further expands my ability to sample sources and combine different forms of media. 
I didn’t see how these tools could benefit my work until I started to learn how to use them. <br>
Through my last two years in this program, I have come to realize that a major component of what entices me about digital media art is its ability to be interactive. 
Some of my fondest memories from visiting museums as a child involve twisting knobs on a wall full of lights to change their color, or pressing buttons to make a kaleidoscope spin. 
I have always found that interactive art has a unique opportunity to make a lasting impression on viewers, because it invites an interactive experience rather than a passive process. <br>
Moving forward, I would like to grow my toolkit of digital art skills, particularly those involving creative coding to a point where I can use them to further my
